## AZURE AND AIRFLOW TRAINING

I have tried the wrangling task with normal dataflow and not power query as power query was not working, the fix is now found and will update later

The initial tasks and labs werent tracked by but were done properly.

For git Config pipeline:
upon running git pull we can see the changes saved by the pipeline
